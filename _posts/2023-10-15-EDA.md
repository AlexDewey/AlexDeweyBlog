## Introduction ##

When working with a new dataset as a researcher there's an important aspect in first how we approach said data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of detecting mistakes in data, checking assumptions, evaluating relationships between variables, and selecting relevant variables for further analysis and model design. There's a lot more to say on what this process encompasses, which is what we'll be getting into. But before we do let's review some prerequisite knowledge.

## Reviewing Terms ##

<ul>
  <li>
    Probability Functions: They can be used to describe the probability of outcomes either in said discrete manner or by taking the area under a curve. Naturally they add up to 1 and will be in a bar chart (PMF) form for discrete values or a function (PDF) for continuous values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mean: Average Value.

  <li>
    Variance: Average difference from the average value.
