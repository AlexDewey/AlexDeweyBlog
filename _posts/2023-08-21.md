In my research and understanding of multimodal models in health, I came across a modality that I dreaded; unidimensional data.
How do you deal with such a modality? What's tricky is that unlike other modalities it isn't discussed as much and oftentimes feels underdeveloped in the literature.
With no formal training in how to deal with this topic, I went back and read the first seven chapters of "Biomedical Signal and Image Processing by Kayvan Najarian and Rover Splinter".
These chapters that I'll cover the first five of momentarily discuss the basics required to proceed with research in the domain of biomedical signal processing.

### Chapter 1: Signals and Processing ###

The most we really get from here is an introduction. Stuff like how a signal is a 1-D ordered sequence of numbers. Nothing too tricky.
The authors differentiate between analog signals, dicrete signals, and digital signals, as well as a general overview of processing and extracting features for analysis. (We'll touch more on this later).
This book goes into image feature extraction as well, which isn't as useful given modern-day technological advancements in CNNs, but nonetheless are brought up. They will serve a purpose but again, we'll touch more on this later.

### Chapter 2: Fourier Transform ###

Immediately starting off with the heavy hitters we have fourier transforms (FTs). FTs are essentially the decomposition of signals into composite frequencies.
Every wave complex can be made up of a group of sinosoidal waves oscillating at different frequencies, and FTs break down a wave into these smaller wave coefficients.
[The 3B1B video on FTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) is one of the best, and starts off by discussing that of the "Almost Fourier Transform", where by recording the center of mass of the signal spun around a circle gives us interesting properties.
This seems incredibly unintuitive on why we'd make this step, and I get that, but it'll work out nicely.
What this does for us however is it means the center of mass is only really away from the middle of the circle when the frequency of the sign wave is the same, in which if forms a circle.

The x-coordinate for center of mass can be added and subtracted to get good approximates of the original signal. The original signal is spun around this circle and then can be decomposed around unique frequencies that build up the original signal.
Before we get to the actual FT let's build up the math.
The actual way to rotate about a circle clockwise is to use imaginary numbers. The expression below demonstrates this ability to circle around the axis where t is time.

$$ e^{-2\pi it} $$

We can then multiply by the frequency f that controls the speed of how fast we go around the circle.
The intensity as a function of g(t) multiplied to the equation allows us to do our better FT.
The center of mass then corresponds to the following integral:

$$ \frac{1}{t2-t1} \int_t1^t2 g(t)e^{-2\pi ift}dt $$

But we don't actually care about the center of mass, we can get rid of the 1 over t2-t1 and just scale up our center of mass vector by multiplying our value by the number of seconds.

$$ \int_t1^t2 g(t)e^{-2\pi ift}dt $$

We have to take discrete measurments and try to form a continuous signal.
To have confidence we're not missing anything we find the fastest frequency in our signal and make sure we're recording twice as fast as the fastest signal. This is referred to as the Nyquist rate.
Because we can only measure in discrete measurments, we have the discrete fourier transform (DFT) as the following equation:

$$ X_{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n}e^{-2\pi i * kn * \frac{1}{N}}, n=0,...,N-1 $$

For N complex numbers x<sub>{n}</sub> into another sequence of complex numbers X<sub>N</sub>.

Inverse transformers exist for both reverting the continuous and discrete FTs to their original state. No information is lost in this process.
FT can have hard cutoffs for low-pass filters to eliminate noise, but also softer caps such as the Butterworth filter that gradually eliminates noise to eliminate noise while having a more uniform sensitivity for desired frequencies.
